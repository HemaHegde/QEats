1) Make sure that the class you want to use is part of the SpringContext such that when the class that wants to use it should be able to scan it. 

2) Let Spring handle the creating of the instances and you focus on the business logic.

3) If there are any exceptions that get raised, try to go through the documentation of Spring to figure why the exception is being raised.
   You are most likely to get a solution if you figure out the reason behind the exception.
